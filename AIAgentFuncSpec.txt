**Baby Manager Agent – Function Specification**

**Purpose:**
An AI agent that helps parents manage baby care by recording key baby activities and providing intelligent suggestions based on time and past records.

---

**Core Functionalities:**

1. **Record Baby Activities**

   - **Record Feeding**
     - Input: `milk_amount (int, in ml)`, `feeding_time (optional, default to now)`
     - Function: Stores the amount and time of feeding

   - **Record Sleep**
     - Input: `sleep_start_time`, `sleep_end_time`
     - Function: Stores baby’s sleep duration

   - **Record Diaper Change**
     - Input: `change_time (optional, default to now)`
     - Function: Stores time when diaper was changed

2. **Suggest Actions Based on History**

   - **Should Feed?**
     - Logic: Based on last feeding time and milk amount
     - Rules:
       - If no record exists → Suggest feeding
       - If >3 hours since last feeding → Suggest feeding
       - If <100ml last time and >2 hours passed → Suggest feeding

   - **Should Sleep?**
     - Logic: Based on time since last wake-up
     - Rules:
       - If baby has been awake >2 hours → Suggest sleep
       - If recent nap ended <2 hours ago → No need to sleep yet

   - **Should Change Diaper?**
     - Logic: Based on last change time
     - Rules:
       - If >2 hours since last change → Suggest checking or changing

---

**Optional Future Features:**

- Export daily log summary
- Personalized feeding/sleep pattern detection
- Mobile push notifications

---

**Example Interaction Flow:**

```
User: "The baby drank 120ml milk just now"
Agent: "✅ Feeding recorded: 120ml at 10:42 AM"

User: "Should I feed the baby again?"
Agent: "🕒 It's been 3 hours since the last feeding. Recommended to feed now."

User: "She woke up at 9AM, should she nap?"
Agent: "🛌 She’s been awake for 2.5 hours. Time for a nap!"
```
