## 1. Core Functional Modules (Agents)

### 1. Baby Manager Agent
**Description**:  
Manages baby records by logging feeding, diaper changes, bowel movements, sleep patterns, and cry detection. It sets reminders and tracks data to predict health milestones. For example, it recommends when the baby might begin teething and suggests introducing finger foods along with guidance on which finger foods to prepare.

### 2. Task Manager Agent
**Description**:  
Oversees household chores and personal tasks. It auto-generates reminders and task lists. For instance, if the baby has a doctor appointment, the agent will automatically generate a checklist of items to bring (e.g., healthcare card, vaccine record, etc.). It can also auto-assign tasks to others if the mom isn‚Äôt feeling well, and integrates with calendar scheduling.

### 3. Emotional Companion Agent
**Description**:  
Monitors the mom‚Äôs emotional state by tracking key metrics such as HRV, respiration rate, and body temperature. In addition, it considers factors like baby cry duration and the number of tasks completed during the day to determine if emotional support is needed, then provides timely interventions and motivational support.

### 4. Health Manager Agent
**Description**:  
Analyzes the mom‚Äôs health data and provides personalized suggestions and workout recommendations.

**Data Collection**:  
Integrates with Apple HealthKit to retrieve comprehensive metrics‚Äîincluding HRV, heart rate, temperature, sleep, respiratory rate, and activity data‚Äîespecially during the mom's menstrual period.

**Actionable Insights**:  
Suggests appropriate actions, such as taking a walk when the weather is nice or resting if the mom has been on her feet too long, and recommends additional rest during the menstrual period.

**Personalized Recommendations**:  
Offers tailored workout tips and lifestyle advice based on current health metrics.

### 5. Mom Q&A Agent
**Description**:  
Provides instant answers to parenting-related questions via a chatbot interface. The agent is accessible anytime in both text and voice formats and can, for example, advise on whether the baby‚Äôs poop color is normal, offer feeding tips, or suggest solutions for sleep issues.

### 6. Health Analytics Agent
**Description**:  
Analyzes health trends for both mom and baby by correlating various data points. It generates periodic reports and sends alerts if concerning patterns are detected‚Äîfor example, linking excessive crying to possible hunger or sleepiness.
